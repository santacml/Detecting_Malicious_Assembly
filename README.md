# Detecting_Malicious_Assembly

Hello!

Honestly, the code in this repo isn't pretty and I wouldn't recommend cloning or forking it.

I've made leaps and bounds of progress since the NAECON 2018 paper, and all of that code is [in this repo]( https://github.com/santacml/Malware-as-Video)

If you're interested in my work, I would recommend reading my thesis & papers, available [on my website!](santacml.github.io)
