# Detecting_Malicious_Assembly

Hello!

Honestly, the code in this repo isn't pretty and I wouldn't recommend cloning or forking it.

I'm currently in the process of trying to publish some work that expands on the work done here significantly. When that work gets approval for publication, I will release code for that work along with a reworked version of this code that is *much* easier to use.

This repo will stay up for now, but once the new repo is all ready to go, I'll likely just delete everything in here. It'll hopefully be in about a month or so.

Thanks and stay tuned!
